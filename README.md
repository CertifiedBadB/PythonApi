## Small Introduction
_Hello there! I'm Jordy Huijgens, and I'm exited to present my work on this Python/flask assignment. I've embarked on this assignment with the goal of showcasing my skills and enthusiasm for joining your team. It was very fun 
and actually not that hard to make a API in Python, I have never done this before, I normally make my API's in Node.js. So for the build I did use a tutorial.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification on any aspect of my work. C;
Thank you for considering me for this opportunity. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team!
I put around 2 hours of time into this project, and as the email said it should be a simple restfull api, so this is the final result_

## Difficulties

_I think the part I found most difficult was Pythons syntax, because it is very importent to get your tabs right.
Normally I would love to add swagger for documentation but I havent done this because I had a really busy week._

## How to use the API

_1. Download my repository_

_2. Change my example.env into a .env file_

_3. Install the requirements by running _
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
_4. now you can just run the application, I had to run it like this:_
``` 
py -m pipenv shell
```
``` 
flask run
``` 
## Where to use the API for
_I made this Api for articles, a article has a title, a description and maby a uri for a photo.
Everytime you push a article to the database the creationdate is added, so people can see how old the article is_
